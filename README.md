I need help with the 2nd mode or the abyss mode 

The mode must function like this exactly. A timer in the UI will be set for 5 minutes each time the user guesses correctly it will automatically add 10 seconds to the timer however not exceeding 5 minutes

After the game is over a message box will appear saying the game is over your number of correct guesses is : the number of the correct guesses 

Also the user has unlimited tries

For normal mode I want to optimize it in a way that if the user enters a random letter in the textbox the a message box should pop up as an invalid guess please type a Genshin Impact character
